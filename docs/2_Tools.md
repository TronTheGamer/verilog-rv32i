## Verilog Compiler and Tools

### Icarus Verilog

> [!NOTE]
> **Icarus Verilog (iVerilog)** is a free, open-source tool that simulates and synthesizes Verilog hardware designs. It can be used to perform tasks like checking for coding errors, writing compiled design files, and linking modules.

#### Installation

The installation of Icarus Verilog can be done using the package manager of your operating system.

**_Ubuntu_**

```bash
sudo apt-get install iverilog
```

**_Arch Linux_**

```bash
sudo pacman -S iverilog
```

#### Usage

Inorder to test a verilog-hdl file and testbench, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a verilog-hdl file and a testbench file in the same directory.

Example:

```bash
.
├── ALU_tb.v
└── ALU.v
```

2. Run the following command to compile the verilog files.

```bash
iverilog -o <outputfile_name> ALU.v ALU_tb.v
```

> [!IMPORTANT] Here the `outputfile_name` is the name of the file that you want to generate after compiling the verilog files.

3. Run the compiled file to simulate the design.

```bash
vvp <outputfile_name>
```

> [!NOTE]
> This prints out the output of the simulation to the terminal.
> [!TIP]
> You can include `$dumpfile("dump.vcd"); $dumpvars;` in your testbench to generate a waveform data file (`.vcd`).
> > Which can be viewed using `gtkwave`.
> > [!NOTE] For further informtion on `gtkwave` visit ![gtkwave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.io/gtkwave.png) and check out the [gtkwave section](###GTKWave)

### GTKWave

> [!NOTE]
> **GTKWave** is a VCD waveform viewer based on the GTK library. This viewer support VCD and LXT formats for signal dumps. GTKWAVE is available on github here. Most Linux distributions already include gtkwave prepackaged.

#### Installation

The installation of GTKWave can be done using the package manager of your operating system.

**_Ubuntu_**

```bash
sudo apt-get install gtkwave
```

**_Arch Linux_**

```bash
sudo pacman -S gtkwave
```

#### Usage

To view the waveform data file generated by the simulation, you can follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to open the waveform viewer.

```bash
gtkwave dump.vcd
```

> [!NOTE]
> Here `dump.vcd` is the waveform data file generated by the simulation.
