# RISC-V RV32I Hardware Design

This repository contains the hardware design of a RISC-V RV32I processor. The design is written in Verilog and is intended to be synthesized and run on an FPGA. The design is based on the RISC-V RV32I base integer instruction set.

This project's aim is to provide a simple, clean, and easy to understand RISC-V processor design that can be used as a base for further development and learning.
